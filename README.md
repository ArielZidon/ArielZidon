### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ariel Zidon, I'm a Computer Science & Mathematics BSc student at Ariel University. I'm making a great effort to keep this GitHub profile up to date with all my latest assignments and personal projects I'm working on, so you could get a clue for what it's like being a CS student.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on app called Angel, you can see it here.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding a job and generally a place that will take me one step further in the high-tech world.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you want hope I can help
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: facebook - https://www.facebook.com/ariel.zidon/
- âš¡ Fun fact: I try to play basketball at least once a week.
