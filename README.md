### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ariel Zidon, I'm a Computer Science & Mathematics BSc student at Ariel University. I'm making a great effort to keep this GitHub profile up to date with all my latest assignments and personal projects I'm working on, so you could get a clue for what it's like being a CS student.

<!-- - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
